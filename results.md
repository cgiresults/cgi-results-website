The American Case Management Association (ACMA) is non-profit professional membership organization for hospital / health system case management professionals. In 2012, CGi and ACMA’s leadership identified the need in this profession for better training tools. Much of the trainng for new individuals entering the field was “on-the-job” and based on a preceptor model. With the complexities of this field and rapidly changing healthcare regulations, this left gaps in practitioner competency.

CGi engage to meet this need and create a potential new revenue stream for ACMA. Our approach focused on three elements:
To create a minimum viable product (MVP). This was an unproven product concept, and CGi minimized development expenses. The result was a solid initial product offering, but one that excaped large development or maintenance expenses and minimized risk to ACMA. 

To leverage our network of subject matter experts. ACMA already had as engage members many of the key leaders at major hospitals and health systems around the country. We engaged these individuals to identify their needs, and a smaller group to become our subject matter experts (SMEs) and produce a curriculum.
To focus on content first. Our belief was that if we could create outstanding content that met the high standards of our engaged leaders, then we would have a new product that could be grown rapidly.
Four years later, this product has exceeded all expectations. Branded as ACMA’s Compass Directional Training, this product is now used in approximately 1,100 US hospitals with over 18,000 trainees completing the curriculum annually. Compass has become the standard for orientation training and annual competency for the field of hospital case management. 

For ACMA, this has created a sustainable revenue stream that rivals its traditional sources of membership dues and annual convention. 
Perhaps more important, this revenue stream is highly diversified. Compass is sold to hospitals and health systems whereas ACMA’s membership is individual. Moreover, almost all Compass sales are part of a multi-year contract with an annual renewal.

“I find Compass an excellent resource for all staff engaged in Care Management, be they nurses, social workers or physicians. It works not just for orienting new hires, but for seasoned staff as well. I will continue to recommend Compass for the value it holds for any organization seeking to bring its team to a higher level of practice.”
