At CGi, our mission is to create growth and strategic results for associations, businesses, meetings and events.  We are a small but rapidly growing company of 45 people with offices in Little Rock, AR and Nashville, TN.  You can find out about part of what we do by visiting our client site at http://www.acmaweb.org/
 
CGi provides an array of services: association and event management services, as well as educational and analytical products/services to hospitals and health system clients. 

Our standards are high. Very high. We have built our growth on exceeding our client expectations and managing the details. 

CGi is not a place where staff can fade into the background or avoid notice. We want people who want to have a voice in business operations, work independently, and grow with us. 

Is this you? Then take a look at our open positions below.
