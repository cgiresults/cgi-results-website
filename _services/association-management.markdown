Short Description: Members are the reason an association exists. Let CGi create a
  solid infrastructure and drive your membership growth and services.
---

CGi provides full service association management, including membership services; data
management, accounting, customer service, growth; chapter development; fundraising and
grants; marketing, communications and social media; and industry surveys and analytics.
An association, at its core, is a community people or organizations that share common goals. At
CGi, we believe that your association’s members are its core purpose. To serve their needs is the
reason an association exists.

>>> Don't underestimate the power of your vision to change the world. Whether that world is your
office, your community, an industry or a global movement, you need to have a core belief that
what you contribute can fundamentally change the paradigm or way of thinking about problems.

- Leroy Hood

Exceeding the expectation of your members requires streamlined infrastructure and well-tuned
operations. CGi will provide the structure and manage your operational processes to create the
foundation of committed, long-term members who believe in your mission and are impressed by
your association’s level of service. These members become your advocates, and are invaluable to
create growth.

With a solid foundation of high service levels and loyal members, your organization can then
pursue other strategic initiatives that further your vision. Whether this is creating new benefits,
conducting research, or engaging in legislative activities, CGi has the experience and
infrastructure to partner with you to achieve your vision.
