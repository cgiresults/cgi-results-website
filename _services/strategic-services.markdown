    <h2>Strategic Planning</h2>

    <p>
    Where will your organization’s greatest impact be? What are the organizational accomplishments that you believe are possible? Translating these from a vision to a workable plan is where CGi’s strategic services can help.
    Let CGi partner with you to clarify your vision and build an operational plan to achieve it.
    </p>

    <p>
    Strategic planning is a structured process that moves an organization from abstract (vision, ideas) to practical
    (what will it take to achieve these) and tactical (which are we going to pursue now?). CGi regularly
    leads a variety of groups and organizations through this process to produce executable plans.

    Broad vision and innovative plans require funding. Planning for funding and potential revenue creation is a key part of the strategic services CGi offers. To fund association initiatives, CGi has successfully created sustainable revenue streams, conducted fundraising campaigns, and won six-figure grants.

### Certification Development
For many associations, a powerful way to serve their members and advance their field of practice is to
create a certification process that validates competency in their field of practice. Creating a certification
is a significant undertaking and complex process - one that CGi has successfully led multiple times. We have extensive experience in building, managing and marketing practice certifications.

### Public Policy / Legislative Advocacy

The dream of many association leaders is to influence the laws and regulations that impact their industry. Since 2008, CGi has led advocacy efforts on behalf of our association clients at a national level, collaborating with lobbying firms, conducting legislative research, and orchestrating Capital Hill Advocacy events with over 200 member participants.
