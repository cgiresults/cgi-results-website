    <h2>Strategic Planning</h2>

    <p>
    Where will your organization’s greatest impact be felt? What are the accomplishments that you dream
    about? Translating these from a vision to a workable plan is where CGi’s strategic services can help you.
    Let CGi partner with you to clarify your vision and build a plan to achieve it.
    </p>

    <p>
    Strategic planning is a structured process that moves an organization from abstract (vision, ideas) to practical
    (what will it take to achieve these) and to tactical (which are we going to pursue now?). CGi regularly
    leads a variety of groups and organizations through this process to produce executable plans.

    Broad vision and innovative plans require funding. Planning for funding and potential revenue
    creation is a key part of the strategic services CGi offers. CGi has successfully created sustainable revenue streams to fund association initiatives, conducted fundraising campaigns, and won six-figure grants.

### Certification Development
For many associations, a powerful way to serve their members and advance their field of practice is to
create a certification process that validates competency in their field of practice. Creating a certification
is a significant undertaking and complex process - one that CGi has successfully led multiple times. We have extensive experience in building, managing and marketing practice certifications.

### Public Policy / Legislative Advocacy

The dream of many association leaders is to be able to influence the laws and regulations that affect their
industry. For the last several years, CGi has led advocacy efforts on behalf of our association
