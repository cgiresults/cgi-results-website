Short Description: |-
  Strategic planning is about the future; that is where your organization's greatest impact should be
  realized. CGi will help you create and achieve a vision based on your members' needs.
---

Where will your organization’s greatest impact be felt? What are the accomplishments that you dream
about? Translating these from a vision to a workable plan is where CGi’s strategic services can help you.
Let CGi partner with you to clarify your vision and build a plan to achieve it.

>>> A goal without a plan is just a wish.

### Strategic Planning
Strategic planning is a structure process that moves a group from abstract (vision, ideas) to practical
(what will it take to achieve these) and to tactical (which are we going to pursue now?). CGi regularly
leads a variety of groups through this process to produce executable plans.

### Finance
Broad vision and innovative plans require funding, and planning for funding and potential revenue
creation is a key part of the strategic services CGi offers. CGi has successfully created sustainable revenue
streams to fund association initiatives, conducted fundraising campaigns, and won six-figure grants.

>>> Someone's sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago.

### Certification Development
For many associations, a powerful way to serve their members and advance their field of practice is to
create a certification process that validates competency in their field of practice. Creating a certification
is a significant undertaking and complex process - one that CGi has successfully led multiple times. We have deep experience in building, managing and marketing practice certifications.

### Public Policy / Legislative Advocacy

The dream of many association leaders is to be able to affect the laws and regulations that affect their
industry. For the last several years, CGi has led advocacy efforts on behalf of our association
