>>> You need to create ridiculously good content â€“ content that is useful, enjoyable and inspired.

For many professionals, educational content needs to include continuing education (CE) coverage. This

body often has its own, unique, requirements. CGi can ensure that content is built and delivered in a
compliant manner, and has existing CE infrastructure to provide credit to learners.
