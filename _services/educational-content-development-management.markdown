    Content that educates, inspires and captivates - that is the goal. Great content compels organizations to purchase content, and attendees to register for events. Striking the correct balance of each element can be difficult, but when achieved the content is powerful, and the result becomes valuable intellectual property.

    For many professionals, educational content needs to include continuing education (CE) coverage. This brings a myriad of new requirements to the development and delivery of content as each professional body often has its own unique regulatory requirements. CGi can ensure that content is built and delivered in a compliant manner, and has the existing CE infrastructure to provide credit to trainees.
