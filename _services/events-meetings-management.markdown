Short Description: Events are complex, and events are your brand. The best events create a memorable experience and
make participants want to come back. CGi can build events from a raw concept or evolve your existing
event to a new level.
---

Your events are your brand. You create an experience for your participants, and this experience conveys
to them your identity and vision.
CGi has a wealth of experience in event development, management, and growth.
We can manage all aspects of planning (venue research, contracting, logistics, etc), marketing,
production, sponsorship sales, and trade show coordination.

>>> They may forget what you said - but they will never forget how you made them feel.

—Carl W. Buehner

## New events

A new event starts with a concept. CGi will work with you to clarify your vision. This often means
bringing together others to share your vision and contribute their knowledge and ideas. CGi will
facilitate all aspects to refine a concept into a workable project plan.

CGi will then execute this plan. We will leverage our broad network to engage the most suitable venue,
speakers, and entertainment. At all times keeping in mind that the participant’s experience.

New events often require an intense marketing push to create a compelling reason to attend, and get
the message out to your potential audience of participants and, potentially, sponsors.

## Existing events

Existing events provide both advantages and challenges. It is beneficial to have an existing brand and
past participants provide an engaged audience.

However, how do you keep an existing event from becoming stagnant? How do you make each
experience memorable for participants, and create in them a strong desire to attend your next event.

CGi's portfolio includes events that we have been managing - and growing - for over 20 years. This also
requires constant innovation on a successful model to keep our content relevant to a changing
environment, and to constantly seek to make the experience memorable, for both the first-time
attendee and those who come each year.
