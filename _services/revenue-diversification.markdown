<h2>Sustainable Revenue Streams</h2>

    <p>
      Traditionally modeled associations - those that are solely reliant on revenue from membership dues and an annual meeting / convention - are at risk. This model tends to be highly dependent on the economy. In years of
      economic recession, individuals or organizations may "skip" their membership or travel expenses for a
      year. For a non-diversified association, this can be disastrous.
    </p>
    <p>
      The solution that CGi has built for other association clients is diversity in revenue streams. While
      membership dues and a large annual event remain major contributors, we can ensure they are not the
      only contributors by building other sustainable revenue streams that can equal or surpass traditional
      sources.
