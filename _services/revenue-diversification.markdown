  sources of non-dues and non-event revenue.

Traditionally modeled associations are at risk - those who are solely reliant on revenue from membership dues and an annual meeting / convention. These tend to be dependent on the economy. In years of
economic recession, individuals or organizations may "skip" their membership or travel expenses for a
year. For a non-diversified association, this can be disastrous.

The solution that CGi has built for other association clients is diversity in revenue streams. While
membership dues and a large annual event remain major contributors, we can ensure they are not the
only contributors and build other sustainable revenue streams that can equal or surpass these traditional
sources.

CGi's structure is designed to identify entrepreneurial opportunities for its clients, and then manage
these effectively using our dedicated product/service development, account management, and sales
resources.
