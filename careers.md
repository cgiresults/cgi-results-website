	At CGi, our mission is to create growth and strategic results for associations, businesses, meetings and events. Founded in 2005, we are a small but rapidly growing company under 50 people with our headquarters in Little Rock, Arkansas and remote staff located across the nation. CGi provides an array of association and event management services, as well as educational and analytical products/services to hospitals and health system clients. We are always seeking talented individuals to join our team.

    <p>
    Our standards are high. Very high. We have built our foundation on exceeding our clients' expectations and by managing the details. 
    </p>

    <p>
    CGi is not a place where staff can fade into the background or avoid notice. We want people who want to have a voice in business operations, work independently, and grow with us.
