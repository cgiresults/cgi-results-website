### Market Intelligence Analyst
The Market Intelligence Analyst must have a passion for business intelligence – not just data, but taking that data and providing rapid decisional information to business unit leaders. In this role, you will be able – and called upon - to make a significant and visible impact on the company. This is not a role for someone who wants to operate within a set of defined tasks and stay under the radar. We will look to you to keep us from being data rich, but information poor.<br />
This role requires an individual with an entrepreneurial mindset, and the vision and ability to build systems that provide needed market feedback to business unit leaders without manual processes and to consistently improve our data collection, storage, and reporting. In addition, this role will be tasked with leading planned projects that will break ground in healthcare research. Finally,
while technical expertise is great (and necessary), it is this mindset that will make you successful in this role.<br />
